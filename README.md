# Rainfall-prediction
This project presents a Rainfall Prediction System using machine learning techniques to forecast rainfall effectively. The system utilizes historical weather data and implements the Random Forest Classification algorithm to predict rainfall based on multiple meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
